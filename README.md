# template_content_generator
generating template content such as about us, news artical, news title, product description and etc. using pretrained Language Model GPT-3

## Introduction
The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language or code.

GPT-3 or the third generation of Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a neural network machine learning model trained 
using internet data to generate any type of text. It requires a small amount of input text to generate large volumes of 
relevant and sophisticated machine-generated text.

GPT-3's deep learning neural network is a model with over 175 billion machine learning parameters. As a result GPT-3 is
better than any prior model for producing text that is convincing enough to seem like a human could have written it.

## What can GPT-3 do?
Natural Language processing includes as one of its major components natural langauge generation. which focus on generating
human langauge natural text. However, generating human understandable content is a challenge for machines that don't really
know the complexities and nuances of language. Using text on the internet, GPT-3 is trained to generate realistic human text.

GPT-3 has been used to create articles, poetry, stories, news reports and dialogue using just a small amount of input text
that can be used to produce large amounts of quality copy.

GPT-3 is also being used for automated conversational tasks, responding to any text that a person types into the computer 
with a new piece of text appropriate to the context. GPT-3 can create anything with a text structure, and not just human 
language text. It can also automatically generate text summarizations and even programming code.
