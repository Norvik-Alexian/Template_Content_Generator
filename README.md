# template_content_generator
generating template content such as about us, news artical, news title, product description and etc. using pretrained Language Model GPT-3

## Introduction
The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language or code.

GPT-3 or the third generation of Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a neural network machine learning model trained 
using internet data to generate any type of text. It requires a small amount of input text to generate large volumes of 
relevant and sophisticated machine-generated text.

GPT-3's deep learning neural network is a model with over 175 billion machine learning parameters. As a result GPT-3 is
better than any prior model for producing text that is convincing enough to seem like a human could have written it.

## What can GPT-3 do?
Natural Language processing includes as one of its major components natural langauge generation. which focus on generating
human langauge natural text. However, generating human understandable content is a challenge for machines that don't really
know the complexities and nuances of language. Using text on the internet, GPT-3 is trained to generate realistic human text.

GPT-3 has been used to create articles, poetry, stories, news reports and dialogue using just a small amount of input text
that can be used to produce large amounts of quality copy.

GPT-3 is also being used for automated conversational tasks, responding to any text that a person types into the computer 
with a new piece of text appropriate to the context. GPT-3 can create anything with a text structure, and not just human 
language text. It can also automatically generate text summarizations and even programming code.

## How does GPT-3 work?
GPT-3 is a language prediction model. This means that it has a neural network machine learning model that can take input
text as an input and transform it into what it predicts the most useful result will be. This is accomplished by training 
the system on the vast body of internet text to spot patterns. More specifically, GPT-3 is the third version of a model
that is focused on text generation based on being pre-trained on a huge amount of text.
